# ⚗️ MFNG AI SDK Generative UI Demo

This demo showcases a chat assistant capable of displaying images of various
kinds.

Built using [MFNG](https://github.com/unstubbable/mfng/) — a minimal React
Server Components (RSC) bundler & library — and the
[Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), this demo leverages RSCs to
[seamlessly integrate text with UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/concepts/ai-rsc)
as generated by the LLM.

The app is deployed on AWS Lambda & CloudFront. Due to cost considerations, it
is heavily rate-limited, which may result in occasional error responses.

You can try it out at

## Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed on your local development machine.
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Install

To install the dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Define the following environment variables, e.g., using
[direnv](https://direnv.net):

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (**required**)
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY`: Your Google Custom Search JSON API key (optional)
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`: Your Google Custom Search JSON API Search
  Engine ID (optional)

**Note:** When the two Google Custom Search JSON API environment variables are
not defined, the chat will still function properly; however, images will not be
displayed, and error messages will be shown instead.

For more information on the Google Custom Search JSON API, visit:
[https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction)

### Dev Server

To start the dev server (which watches for file changes), run:

```
npm run dev
```

Recording and replaying OpenAI responses can be enabled by starting the dev
server as follows:

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/v1/ npm run dev
```

### Browser

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
