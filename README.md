# ⚗️ MFNG AI SDK Generative UI Demo

This demo showcases a chat assistant capable of displaying images of various
kinds.

Built using [MFNG](https://github.com/unstubbable/mfng/) — a minimal React
Server Components (RSC) bundler & library — and the
[Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), this demo leverages RSCs to
[seamlessly integrate text with UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/concepts/ai-rsc),
as generated by the LLM.

The app is deployed on AWS Lambda & CloudFront. Due to cost considerations, it
is heavily rate-limited, which may result in occasional error responses.
